# PixelPlace

A simple collaborative pixel canvas built with **Python** and **Flask**, ready to deploy with **Docker Compose**.

It runs in localhost:5000 which is customizable. 

## Features

- Flask-based backend
- 64x64 pixel canvas (customizable)
- Easy deployment with Docker
- The canvas is currently stored in RAM, meaning all drawings are lost when the app is restarted

## Getting Started

### Local Run

```bash
docker-compose up --build

```
